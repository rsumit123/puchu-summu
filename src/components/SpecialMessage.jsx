        Puchu Baby.. I love you too much babes. You have sorted my life in a way that i cant express. You have taught me responsibilty, seriousness and how to deal with life's problems and more importantly you have taught me how to love. I will always love you forever!! No matter how you feel, i will always be there for you. I want to be that constant in your life that never changes, no matter what happens.
